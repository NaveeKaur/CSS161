## Projects from CSS 161 (Intro to Programming I) at UWB 

### Summary of Projects 
* HW1: A program that outputs two distinct levels or boards from a Mario game. 

* HW2: If/else TODO statements. 

* HW3: [Assignment Description](http://faculty.washington.edu/rynn/assignment_website/index.html) 

* HW4: A program that calculate and create a report of some basic statistics and genomic quantities on DNA base-pair sequences. The sequences are entered in from the console.

* HW5: A class averaging program (here “class” means a course, not an element of the Java language). This software will read input data from a file describing specific classes and students, and will calculate weighted averages for each student (as well as a pass/fail mark).

* HW6: A program that collects three pieces of user input about a race and provides a summary of facts about the race. The three pieces of user input will be the three individual race times that correspond the first, second, and third top race finishers; the program will prompt the user to enter these in via the keyboard.

* HW7: A program with the classes Skydiver, Skydive, and DiveDriver that calculates the velocity of a skydiver as a function of time. The main program will be in the class DiveDriver and will include a loop that allows to enter in the specifications for more than one jump.

* HW8: The purpose of this code is to create a template for PAM250 to compare DNA sequences using a multidimensional array. For example, two DNA sequences <AATGCTA> and <AAGGA> have two gaps and one mistmatch. Essentially, the user would implement these numbers into the main below. The bigger and the more negative the score is, the less related the two DNA sequences are.
